# webrtc-codelabs-demo
It is a WebRTC demo app for video chatting. It's totally based on all the code present in this nice old tutorial -  
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/webrtc-web  

You can try the demo by going to this site : https://expressserver-amtnoolitp.now.sh/  and open the same site using 
another tab in the same computer (to chat with yourself :p) or ask another person to open it up and chat with you.

The site supports only two people at once and only they can video chat :p No seperate room chats. So don't be thrilled if  
you find another person's face while checking out the site. May be he opened up the site just before you did. And only two  
can connect to the site and chat at once. If more people join, they won't be able to communicate with anyone but it won't  
affect the first two people communicating, or it becomes clumsy and no one will be able to chat. :p  

Pretty crazy app. I will soon create an App with seperate rooms!

The site is hosted using https://now.sh
